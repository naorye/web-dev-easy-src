<p>
    My name is Naor Yehudaey (naorye) and I live in the holy city Jerusalem of Israel.
    <br/>
    I am 29 years old, married to my lovely Ilana and we have a female cat named Mutzi.

    Since I remember myself I have always had a great passion developing new apps with
    thrilling and innovative technologies.
    <br/>
    My first big experience was at college, in my seminarion project. Those days
    <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J2me">J2ME</a>
    was the leading technology for mobile, and I had created an application that allows
    sending and receiving emails via mobile phone. This might sound very simple nowadays
    but in the middle of 2003, a lot before Android and iPhone were created, when the
    leading mobile in the israeli market was
    <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3510">Nokia 3510</a>
    it was quite innovative.
</p>
<p>
    Later I understood that mobile apps development is about to change among with the
    desktop apps development. More and more apps moved to the cloud and many different
    development technologies have arisen. The new invention of
    <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_programming">ajax</a>
    and its use in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gmail.com">GMail</a> (2004) was
    a great jump in the web development history that made the JavaScript live again.
    <br/>
    Ever since, I dedicate my spare time to learn and developing new web apps, implementing
    new ideas and learning the new fascinating possibilities of the web.
